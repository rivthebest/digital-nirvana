            Hello, my name is Fernanda I'm Brazilian,

A few months ago I bought my website and soon I will launch ""Cest la vie"" a company aimed at women's fashion a bold and direct fashion brand where you will find the best on-trend fashion options for everyone around the world.

- Content & Keywords:

I'm looking for a writer to add content to the pages of my site. At the moment, most pages on my website do not have enough content. As in the URLs below mentioned for reference:

I need to help fashion my content and my blog as a whole, with a design that can draw customers to the headlines, attract interactions and readings about the fashion world, optimize conversions, and create a lasting impression. so visitors know where to look and find the best they need

Because the world of women's fashion is always innovating and that is why women do not quit being well informed about what will be on the rise and what is the latest women's fashion.

            One of our clients has a production Kubernetes platform which was built for them by a contractor. The client would like an independent health-check and opinion on their Kubernetes infrastructure to check:

-Is it any good?
-Does it follow best practice?
-Is it resillient?
-Is it secure?
-Any other thoughts and recommendations 

As you will be representing us, we are looking for a Kubernetes expert. Somebody who has practical production knowledge and can work with the client over 2 - 3 days to get any access and documentation that they need to evaluate the infrastructure. 
Will likely lead to more and more work as this is an area in which we do not have much expertise available to us.

I'll need you to show me past work examples and have a proven background in developing these artefacts.

If you can provide samples of past work and how you have assisting remotely to plan and execute on this process that will be great. I'll provide more information to shortlisted applicants and the final applicant selected will need to complete and NDA to proceed.

The budget number i have put on this are juts a placeholder, you'll need to tell me what the fixed price is to develop the style guide and then seperate pieces of work, eg the corporate Powerpoint and other recommendations. I'd ideally like to see this stuff end up ion the Playbooks that we have developed for them ( this will also need to be styled to suit) and provide them with something like the attached as a minimum. I'm open to suggestions and ideas here as well as we want to excel in this delivery.        "

            Hey there!

So i have a bedroom roughly 12ft by 13ft, its quite small and its in a 3 bedroom terrace. Its a double room for two people with beds either side and a chimney breast in the middle. 

I need some help with the design. This is a low budget make over and items for the room should be purchased from stores such as John Lewis, IKEA, B&Q and online stores e.g. Amazon, eBay, etc. 

We know what we want, the colour of the room will be Dulux Goose Down, but need ideas on feature walls, what to do with storage, decor, etc.

If you like working on fun little projects, and have a good understanding of creating awesome designs and make overs on a budget of £1.5k, lets talk!         "

            Please NO generic proposal

Please, if you are a UX/Ui designer and you are NOT from UK/USA/Canada, then you must create 3 Ui Screens USING the wireframes provided in this project as part of your proposal for me to consider you for the job. This is because I previously had issues with International designers who were very poor.

If you cannot do the above and you are a overseas UX/Ui designer as described, please DO NOT send a proposal. I am NOT interested in seeing your portfolio, I would like to see work based on the wireframes i provide.

Please READ before sending proposal. Please quote ID located on the bottom when sending proposal otherwise proposal will automatically be rejected.

We are looking for SUPER modern and SLEEK UX/Ui Designers. We are not interested in basic looking designs. Please do not waste your time sending a proposal if you have little experience in designing very sleek and modern designs. 

Here are the wireframes for the App that is simply a guide and can be changed and altered:

We currently do not have wireframes for the website but we expect a user friendly and sleek/modern look.

We are aware we will be receiving proposals from many low quality designers which can be the nature of such platform.

To encourage the project to be accepted by highly experienced and professional individuals, we are offering a 5% share in our digital solutions edutech company based in the United Kingdom instead of payment. 

Please include in your proposal what you prefer.

Please see examples of sleek and modern designs attached. This is the quality we require.

You can receive a return in the event our company (that you become a shareholder) in makes an 'exit' in the future. Different types of exits include a trade sale, IPO or share buyback. 

One of our competitors recently received £3million in investment for their software solution that is trying to address a problem similar to us so there is certainly potential within this industry. 

Our company already has a CTO in place once design has been finished.

            I have two brand new word press websites currently in a staging environment both requiring a full SEO package to ensure they are highly ranked  (white hat only) on google. 

Each website has been built in WordPress including all imagery and page layouts.

The first website consists of a new electric automation gate company. Approximately 21 pages each consisting of a different service that the company offers. E.g. Wooden gates, wrought iron gates, servicing etc etc. 

The second website consists of a local website design agency with a focus on helping small firms develop their website and brand as well as google presence. This website is smaller and contains about 7 pages of the usual website design agency company content that you would typically find amongst other competitor firms. 

Both websites have been fully built but the services pages contain no copy. We currently have copy editors on standby ready to get going writing 250 words for each service  on each of the websites. However, to do this there is a need for optimal keywords that then can be included within the content. 

The SEO needed will first focus on the electric gates automation company. With the website design agency to follow after. WordPress access can be given along with the ability install your preferred SEO plugin. Images will also need SEO attention.

We are flexible as to the approach you wish to carry out doing both websites. For example, if you wish to do the competitor analysis and keyword research of the website and corresponding services pages, to then have the copy writers write the content, and finally finish the SEO then this is absolutely fine. We can work to your preferred chosen method.

Ultimately the end goal is to have two fully functioning highly ranked websites that can be handed over to the clients.

Of course achieving a google top spot takes time and we will then work on further content. Guidance as to how to organically and most importantly achieve a top spot google ranking via a white hat method would ideally be needed. I.e a handover plan as to how to increase the success and ranking of the sites.

English as a first language preferred along with a previous record of achieving similar success.

            I need someone to copy several thousand lines off a website into an excel:

1. Go to website I will give you link 
2. For each stock idea on the left copy into the Excel the date, name, stock ticker, market capitalisation, author, and whether the article was a 'Long' or 'Short' stock idea. I have done an example for April 3, 2019 in an excel template attached here.

To scroll through them all you will need to click the ""load more ideas"" button at the bottom and/or the ""Go to date"" filter at the top. 

Copying for each stock should only take a few seconds, so I think you will be able to copy hundreds per hour. My guess is there are 20,000 stocks and I will pay $250 per 1,000 stocks CORRECTLY filled in (I will manually go through each name in the excel after). In addition I will pay a discretionary bonus of 0-20% as well depending on the quality, so overall this project could be worth $1200. I hope to only use 1 person for this project but extend to more people if the project is slow or the quality is not good.

That means the user should see two prices, it is not necessary to implement a buy now function. The secound price (in gray) is just for information. That means the user can only pay the fixed rental price. The secound price should be displayed in gray (same size) right to the rental price. It should also shown in the search/products overview. (Like in the example page: https://chic-by-choice.com/de/dress-hire)

Attention: I have installed the Plugin RnB from redq. That doesn´t allow to set two prices, the ""rental product"" is a own product category. But maybe you can use and display the number from the weight attribute as secound price. I don´t need that attribute for my articles.

            Book appointment with Estate Agent Directors for Start Up Business.
 
Price for job: £150
 
We have been booking in appointments with Estate Agent Directors but are now unfortunately finding it difficult due to the time at hand and need a skilled B2B Telemarketer to assist with making appointments with directors and decision makers of Estate Agents, large property companies and big landlords.
 
Our Business
 
We are a start up gas, heating and drainage company called Alley & Co (www.alleyandco.co.uk) and we have just introduced a brand new concept by charging only £30 per C12 Certificates for Estate Agents/Big Landlords. We employ qualified DBS vetted Gas Engineers and happy relationship managers.
 
Task at hand:
 
We would like you to book a face to face meetings with the directors/director or someone that is vested in the organisations genuine interest to increase efficiency and decrease costs of thousands of pounds annually for their estate agent(s) to help maximise revenue and their bottom line. This will also increase reliability and efficiency through our ‘Efficiency’ methodology and our ‘Money Back Guarantee Service’ to build a long-term partnership to offer the best value for all their stakeholders involved.
 
It is to do with a gas certification strategy and discuss an innovative proposal for their Estate Agent to help decrease gas certification costs to only £30 per CP12 certificate and increase value for a) landlord b) their estate agent.  Technology is moving very fast and it is becoming very competitive for all businesses, in particular estate agents and we want to help revolutionise particular processes and systems for you and your team.
 
We have a fantastic proposal we would like to present to Directors or vested staff members that have a genuine interest in the estate agent etc.
 
We are usually free Monday’s, Thursdays and Fridays and have expectation for them to be booked in then with the following availability 9am/10am and  12pm/1pm, 3/4pm  and   5/6pm. So 4 appointments a day and 12 appointments a week, with 30 appointments across 3-4 weeks within the month of July ideally.  
 
The meeting will take approx. 15-20 minutes max.
 
We would expect the following:
 
30 Appointments Guaranteed
Calls to be recorded to prove 30 appointments.
Finish off data that have no director names, emails and contact numbers by requesting information on calls.
Full notes on the excel document.  
We would provide you with the following:
 
Data
Product knowledge and information
Sample script  (however you can tailor upon your skilled experience and sales acumen)
From our experience a booking should be made every 30-45 minutes as a maximum.
 
We are ideally looking for someone long-term that we can continue a strong relationship with through PPH once we have measured your success from this job.
 
I look forward to bids!        "

            Hi Everyone,

I'm looking for someone to create some 3D printable dungeon tiles for my online store. I have a system in place and a set of barebone models as well as examples of what I've created so far that I can share. However, I'm not a modeler. This is a small project in the grand scheme of things and would be a chance for us to see how we get on. In the long run, I'd be looking to work with the Freelancer for some time to create several sets of tiles.

This project is to create a couple of basic configuration tiles to add to the current collection and then design a set of tiles with a specific theme to cover all of the basic configurations. There are currently things like walls, floors, doors and feature tiles that need to be designed.

If you've worked on something similar previously, or have worked on 3D printable projects in the past that'd be fantastic.

It'd be another positive if you're into nerdy stuff like D&D or roleplaying / gaming so you have a passion for this sort of thing as well.

I've attached an image of the basic set that I've designed so far.

I am open to hourly or set prices. I'm being realistic here and understand that 3D modelling is an artistic discipline but I do not have £0000's to spend on this. Ideally, I'd set up a test project with you and go from there if we're both happy.        "

            Hello Everyone,

ME:
I'm an amateur writer based in Newcastle and I'm at the stage in my creative process that I need the script reading service from a professional, I have finished the first draft of my screenplay.

WHAT DO I NEED:
Before I start the re-drafting process I would like some detailed feedback/notes on what needs to be fixed, improved, is my formatting, structure right etc.
To my surprise I've struggled to find any freelance script readers/writers based in the Newcastle upon Tyne that could offer the service I require, I extended my search online and some of the prices quoted by these more established companies were not realistic.

MY WORK:
Log-line
After hesitating in the field a soldier leaves the army believing he no longer has the instinct to kill, he’s recruited by the leading intelligence agency to go undercover inside a powerful crime syndicate thus feeding his urge to be self-contained, but to bring down the criminal organisation he must face the looming reality he will have to kill again!

I included a log-line above to give people an idea of the story, it’s a crime drama but the story deals with themes of isolation, loneliness, identity, loyalty etc. I'm not going to say it's an original idea and it's really this and that, I'm sure you all aware there's lots undercover movies. 
The story is set in India, this is just where it's set and with my background and influences this story was needing to get out of me. 

LAST BIT
Indian movies are usually between 2.30 - 2.45 mins so the first draft is 276 pages!
I will slightly lean towards readers that are in the Northeast (if any) and if they know a bit about Indian (Bollywood cinema) would be a bonus but that doesn't mean I wouldn't consider other readers.
I don't need a quick turnaround however I would like it to a reasonable timeline as I need to get the synopsis done and then start writing another idea I have but like the price of your service we can discuss this, please quote me a fixed price if this suits you.

Please message me if you have any questions.

Thank you for considering my project.

The page needs to be designed mobile-first (rendering across all mobile/tablets/desktops). The page will be a very simple clean layout (mainly white). The main feature will be a map of the world (sample attached - I can provide the AI file for this map), when a user hovers any of these countries they should be highlighted/expanded and clickable (to follow a link I will provide):

            Hi,

I am based in UK and I have an ecommerce/woocommerce website. I want to also sell my products internationally but as I am based in UK the only payment gateway I can use for customers which is accepted in India is Paypal which does not accept payments in INR.

Paypal only allows me to accept payment in USD or GBP by default and currently my website is accepting payment in USD.
I had a currency converter plugin which could convert the USD price to INR but when the user proceeded to the checkout, because my Paypal account default currency was in USD an error would appear so user was not able to proceed to checkout unless the currency was converted back into USD.

There are no payment gateways that I know of for international users which allow you to take payment in INR so I was wondering if there is a way of displaying the currency converted to INR amount in the cart, checkout and paypal checkout pages:

https://prnt.sc/oahsed

https://prnt.sc/oahtdc

If the paypal page cannot be changed, is there another solution, for instance, when the paypal checkout page populates can there be a custom page created which will appear instead which will replicate the paypal page but have the currency converted to INR instead, and all the information which is entered into it is fed back into the paypal page?
...or another solution like this...


Many thanks,

Regards,

The following details may assist in your advice: 

- I purchased the property on 17 February 2015 and at the same time the lease term was extended between the landlord and former owner.
- The former owners period of ownership is between 14.08.2013 – 17.02.2015 as far as this can be seen on the previous official copy of the title register. 
- The seller did not mention or disclose any works to the property at the time of purchase.
- The property is on the first floor with a terrace stairway leading to the garden.
- The alleged works are: Window coverage on the terrace (photo will be supplied of property particulars.) There is no ground floor addition or extension or alterations or addition to main structure.
- The covenant in the lease stipulates the following: ‘lessee is not permitted at any time during the said term without the licence in writing of the lessor first obtained to erect or place any additional building or erection on any part of the demised premises and not to make any alteration in plan or elevation of the premises or in any of the party walls or the principal bearing walls or timbers thereof not construct any gateways or openings in any of the fences bounding the demised premises.

Would also need answers to the following:

- Can this be referred to the former owner? 
- is there a limitation of 6 years as there is no deed of covenant directly between me and the landlord?
- Does the said works actually fall within the category of the works specified in the lease?
- Confirm if there is any scope to challenge the above request. If not, can the landlord’s consent and legal fees be challenged?         "

            Need logo for new business would consider higher pay/package for a design concept I like (which would include all rights and file types).

So it’s going to be a mobile bar (Prosecco, beer, champagne, wine, tea, coffee, etc) in a vintage Italian mini truck.  Since it’s likely that this truck may appear in weddings (for photo ops) I want to go black and white for the logo, the truck will be a charcoal grey. Looking for something elegant-ish but fun. In my mind I was thinking about trying to elegantly arrange bubbles that kind of look like a monogram (but I’m not married to any of that) I also thought about possibly incorporating the iconic design (silhouette) of Piaggio Ape50 Van...not married to anything at the moment. Hopefully this somewhat helps.  I'm looking for elegant, so if you feel it looks too much like a logo for a carwash (having bubbles and a vehicle) lets scrap it.  I want a logo that makes people want to go and check us out online to see if we can be at their next event.  Looking for black/white logo with a mix of your classic and iconic designs below or possible modern and minimal.  Also open to whatever you may have visualized from the above info.        "

            1.	So, the following three paragraphs (180 words) will form part of a short training video, and I would like to have a some simple 2D or 3D animation to support the narrative. If it would be useful, you can view some example content from my training videos using the below link, BUT I am open to considering whatever animation you think might work best. 

2.	You can access example content to get an idea of what I am trying to do on another training video extract using this link: https://vimeo.com/275646944/a29e6bbbf6

3.	As you’ll see, I usually do the visuals for the video (a combination of very basic animations and PowerPoint) myself, but I am exploring how I might get some help from freelancers.

4.	The text I would like animation for is as follows:

“For those working in the gambling industry, the expectation to provide fair and safe games that do not exploit addicted consumers is greater now than it ever has been. The better you understand the current thinking and evidence around how games can make gambling addictive, the better equipped you will be to deal with this difficult challenge. 

Individual differences, for example might include an individual’s personality (e.g., are they impulsive), their motivations (e.g., do they want to relax; or do they crave excitement), their gender (men generally tend to be more at risk; but this gender gap is closing), biological and genetic factors (e.g., brain systems of problem gamblers may function differently leading to increased risk-taking). 

Different products have the potential to satisfy different kinds of gambler needs. For example, a gambler who is motivated to relax may be more interested in faster, repetitive games (like a slot machine, for example). In contrast, a gambler who is interested testing their skill may be drawn to more strategic games such as poker).”

You must be confident to deal with execs and offer a First class service, as you will be representing our brand.

We want to offer a few levels of services based on content, turn around time and cover letters etc. 

In order to judge this, it would be helpful to see some examples of the types of CV's you have done and how you work with these clients in terms of requirements upfront and updates etc.

Feel free to email this to me: rayner@thetlcgroup.com

The aim is that the work will start in Mid August. We would imagine small volumes at first with a view to promote and ramp up to higher volumes by October once we have finished our ""trial"" period        "

            I am looking for a reliable and reliable web developer / designer and set up a new website for www.woocontent.com  
What needs redesigning: 
Homepage - https://woocontent.com/
Service pages - https://woocontent.com/content-strategy-services/
Sector pages - https://woocontent.com/travel/
Content type pages - https://woocontent.com/content-hubs/

We wont be changing any content unless needed to fit the new template, but we want the pages to look user friendly, so less content showing with nice drops downs. 
The current sites are slow so we need to factor this and of course we need to consider mobile and lead generation, so strong call to actions.
Open to changing the colour scheme and currently updating the logo.
I have been looking at themes and like this theme: https://demo.qodeinteractive.com/bridge105
I think the best way to work is template page by page,  starting with the homepage then the service and sector pages.
There must be data capture and CTAs on every page.
I want the minimise the amount of plugins we us while sticking the he theme as much as possible.
I would like to get this work completed ASAP in the next couple of weeks.        "

            A website developer and designer is needed to work on existing website, You must be a designer and developer as I need both, there is no point if you can develop but cannot design, because then I have to find a designer. 

You must be good with Wordpress and woocommerce, memberpress, buddypress and very good at working with most popular plugins. 

Please note, I do not want to develop a new website, I already have an existing website and the job is to develop this to incorporate more functions and make look nicer. 

Currently, we require custom features to be built for user accounts. Our website is a music streaming website. Users must be able to order services in their account, like 'buy 1 week song promotion', and 'buy music editing'. This must be accessible only for members, within their accounts. 

Then we require the ability to be able to record and monitor music streams, everytime somebody listens to music, we need to be able to track this, so that we know how much to pay our artists. Currently there is no system in place to track every time somebody plays a song on the website.

We have many jobs after this, this is a long term ongoing project and you will be our developer always. So you need to always be available when we need you, we need quick response from you when we communicate with you, and we need very good price for jobs, we are a new small business startup and so do not have a lot of money so we need cheap prices for jobs. You will have secure long term work and future increase in work. 

Please do not apply for this job if you are just going to give me a generic answer with no explanation on how you propose to do the work, thank you.

I have different 3 different entities with 3 different attributes that need to be machined by 3 different servers (A B C). Based on the attribute, the entities decide which of the three machines it needs. The problem is that ONLY 2 out of 3 machines can work at the same time. It means that, if I'm using machine A and B and is entering an entity that need machine C. I need to change the configuration and for example substitute machine B with C in order to process the part. The substitution of the machine requires a certain time (SET UP TIME). 
In the real case I have more than 3 entities, but once the model is made for 3 entities then it will be easy to modifiy it to put more parts.  
my first idea was to schematize the plant in this way but then I have no Idea of how reproduce the beahviour descripted above.


Do you have an idea of how model the plant? how much does it cost?

We would like a new promotional video producing showing all aspects of our working life, to include office shots, site working shots and shots in adverse weather.

A brief outline of what will be needed is as follows:

Mid to end summer finish, hoping to have a new install happen around Amptil road, Bedford in August.

£5k budget would be the ceiling.

We will endeavour to not do any filming too far though it would be wise to factor in worst case a day filming around the M23 Gatwick area, (this will need to be a proper planning session on our end.)

A 7 site shots plan including 1 office and 1 nights shoot if this is possible, if budget will not allow we can plan for shorter.

Graphic over lays to show up information pertaining to the shots on screen

Animation section showing UK map of our current projects and if possible a short 30 - 60 second animation that tells a story of our company.

Broken down versions of the video for social media purposes

            Hi Freelancers, my name is Simon Clements and I am director of SC23 Creative limited.

As an expansion of my business, I am looking at forging long term relationships with freelance creatives, who I can work with to allow me to expand my business operations.

The first project, is for a client of mine, who is a large national property investment publication, here in the UK. I have worked with them for the last 10 years, building the brand and publication up from scratch. I am looking for someone who can assist with some of the article layouts, hopefully on an ongoing, monthly basis for the right person.

As this is a new posted project, I am going to start by requesting a price for 8 articles to be worked up for me (1x 3-page article, 3x 2-page articles and 4x 1-page articles). I have included PDFs of each size article from last month for reference before quoting.

I can share a dropbox link, which will act as a joint workspace for us to collate assets. I will add the previous months article in indesign format. The style is set and simply needs to be populated with the new content (which will also be supplied in a word document). The styling such as fonts, colours, leading, titles etc MUST remain the same as the previous document to ensure consistency within the publication.

I am available to answer questions on anything to do with the project, as want the process to go smoothly, due to a vision of this being a long term relationship, not only with this publication production but also other work coming over if the right person is found.

Location isn't a prime factor in my decision, providing that communication is great and the standard of work meets my requirements.

Being a printed publication, there are tight deadlines on this, however I do have several of the articles ready to go, the others will come in over the next 7 days. I would need articles back asap from date source material is provided.

Thanks for taking the time in reading this and look forward to your quotes...        "

            Hi there, 

I need an expert on SQL to help me on a project 

Today, some staff put datas on a program made in PHP and datas are going into a database.
Theses datas permit to a financial team to validate some buyers asking 

here some informations about the  content  of SQL 

SQL:
- a view with
the file number
the status (R000, R010, ....) // there are about thirty statutes but only 5 or 6 are significant
date and time of status
which assistant did the operation code + name / first name
(Of course there will be one line per status, so several lines for the same file number)

- a table view with:
the same file number
the type of client (PART ....)
the vendor code of the front
the staff code
- Using lookup tables to find the region or group of the dealership (or will they be positioned?)

STATISTICS :
By concession, by assistant, by group of concessions, by region (all concessions in the region)

DEPTH OF STATISTICS:
MTD (month to date) or YTD (year to date) or date range (start date / end date)

CALCULATIONS NEEDED:
Calculation of deadlines is done between two statuses
it must take into account the hours 9h / 12h and 13h / 18h, except Saturday and Sunday and


The data is centralized in a database on a SQL server or we can have a specific database that recovers the data we want.

We can have a test base reading on file data

I have all details  on this PDF attached 

can you make a detailled proposal with all you will do for making this mission ?

So if you don’t use an account on Upwork, you can create an account and I will use it with my information.
Your information in account in Upwork is public, not private.
I mean we can see that information on other social sites, so it is not private.
Especially for about ID and video verification, Upwork only needs that once.

            We are looking for a simple, professional, dispassionate writing up of our Stag & Vixen relationship using personal interviews and current research. 

Our intended audience is for those in their 30+ who are exploring how to step into this fantastic type of relationship - see the steps we took and the benefits we achieved in our life from it. 

We are not asking to have our choices to be validated in the book - we made our own free choice. It is our intention to have a website to support this book - with mediators and counsellors on an open forum for people to express their views and questions on this subject. There will also be a validated STAG & VIXEN personals to assist others in moving relationships forward.

We will take you behind the private door and show you another world in Chat and Pictures.

Totally NOT what you think it is - this is all about - enjoying sex-charged daily living, using the bodies natural chemical charges and reusing them time and time again. The rediscovery of the excitement of being young. Women become younger looking Vixens and Men become more dynamic Stags.

The feelings overall provide a massive confidence boost and a real kick up the backside to any marriage in the doldrums. 

This is a true story of us as a couple who married for love - settled down - had two children - and slowly sunk into obscurity and debt. One day a chance look changed everything! 

We turned our lives around and with defined and considered steps we now have a very exciting life together and we genuinely believe that life has again - everything to offer us all through our choice to follow a Stad & Vixen Relationship.

We would like to share this with others out there who might similarly benefit.

We have decided for the sake of our children to remain anonymous for the moment. We will decide how to best approach this once the book is written. We will ask for the selected writer to sign an NDA before any money is exchanged.

Persons bidding for this work must understand the nature of this subject involves - Arguments, Photographs (nude and otherwise), Video (nude and otherwise) - and text and internet sites with ""artificial manipulation"" of events. 

All this needs to be detailed and put together in a way that explains the processes and step to becoming a Stag & Vixen - logically without a qualm for the subject matter that, challenges many of societies - ""must accept norms"".

This is a privately funded by us the couple, in this true story and much material has already been gathered.

            Hello,

I recently got involved in selling on eBay and Amazon in what’s called “Private Label” FBA.

I found a company using Alibaba.com before the end of last year and they manufactured arrange of products including neck /scarf travel pillows which were similar to a product on the market called “Trtl travel Pillow”. https://uk.trtltravel.com/products/trtl-travel-pillow

The manufacturer is from China and they explained to me that they manufacture neck/scarf travel pillow like the Trtl travel pillows but their ones were different in two significant ways;

1)	The support was made out of memory foam pillow and not a plastic frame
2)	The material that they used for the fabric was soft cotton and not the fleece fabric on the other product.

After a bit of research, I noted that some of the customer feedback with the original product was the firmness and also how people got hot with the fleece scarf around their neck. 

Anyway fast forward. I customised the product supplied by the Chinese manufacturer (selected a memory foam pillow instead of the plastic frame and also used a cotton fabric which makes sure that the user is more cooler and doesn’t get them sweaty and uncomfortable whilst the using the item). 

I designed my own name private label/logo for this item as the “Snoozz easy Pillow” and the Chinese manufacturer was able to make this for me as part of the package. I ordered 500 units and had them shipped to me in the UK with the intention of selling these on eBay and Amazon.

The listing went live roughly in May 2019 and I’ve managed to sell a handful of these products, then I received an email from eBay stating that they had received an infringement report from a company by the name of “Coolside ltd”. Informed them that they were the rights owner and that I had breached copyright laws. eBay provided me with a contact email for them is; trtl-bp@redpoints.com.

I have now received a block on my Amazon listing and an email from Amazon stating that they had received a report of a breach of “Design Patent Infringement” which was claimed by a company called “convey.it” and that I should contact them directly via their email of enforcement@convey.it. 

Having a look at the patent description and claims of the trtl neck travel pillow, we believe that there are enough differences between the two products and we are seeking advice to the best course of action. 

The frame used in the trtl’s product (fig 7 on their patent document) is a different design to the product I had manufactured in China. They have an H type skeleton frame/structure. In fact, in their patent, it is described as “comprises a single piece of resilient polymeric material” whereas ours is a whole pillow shape made from memory foam.

I also believe that the fabric used in the trtl product is of fleece material whereas the snoozz easy pillow fabric is cotton.

I would, therefore, like help from a solicitor with IP experience;

1)	Review the patent & compare the two product to confirm if I have infringed any design patent or copyright laws.

2)	To advice me on the best course of action; 
3)	Draft a letter to the company who reported my product or to write a DMCA counter-notice if I haven’t breach design patents/copyright legislation
4)	Set out a plan of action in order to get the approval to continual selling snoozz easy pillow.

We currently use 6 different templates for our products to be displayed, and would like to get that down to just 3. Our theme uses METAFIELDS for our upsells and cross sells, and currently only displays on products when we have changed the product template manually. We want the upsells to appear if they are assigned to the product (for example if we have entered the extra metafields required to display an up sell, if we dont enter the extra meta info, there is no upsell to show), and if there is none assigned, we want the product page to appear as normal. If this cant be done its not the end of the world we will stick with the 6 templates (3 currently have an extra column to display the upsells and are displayed in full width).

We also want the 3 ""upsell"" templates to display the same width as the standard templates with no upsells. We are open o options on how best to display the upsells, but we do want to keep them close to the top of the page and to all look as nice as possible.

The listing went live roughly in May 2019 and I’ve managed to sell a handful of these products, then I received an email from eBay stating that they had received an infringement report from a company by the name of “Coolside ltd”. Informed them that they were the rights owner and that I had breached copyright laws. eBay provided me with a contact email for them is; trtl-bp@redpoints.com.

I have now received a block on my Amazon listing and an email from Amazon stating that they had received a report of a breach of “Design Patent Infringement” which was claimed by a company called “convey.it” and that I should contact them directly via their email of enforcement@convey.it. 

Having a look at the patent description and claims of the Trtl neck travel pillow, we believe that there are enough differences between the two products and we are seeking advice to the best course of action. 

The frame used in the Trtl’s product (fig 7 on their patent document) is a different design to the product I had manufactured in China. They have an H type skeleton frame/structure. In fact, in their patent, it is described as “comprises a single piece of resilient polymeric material” whereas ours is a whole pillow shape made from memory foam.

I also believe that the fabric used in the Trtl product is of fleece material whereas the snoozz easy pillow fabric is cotton.

I would, therefore, like help from someone who is a specialist IP litigator, on the following;

1)	Review the patent & compare the two product to confirm if I have infringed any design patent or copyright laws.

2)	To advice me on the best course of action; 
3)	Draft a letter to the company who reported my product or to write a DMCA counter-notice if I haven’t breach design patents/copyright legislation
4)	Set out a plan of action in order to get the approval to continual selling snoozz easy pillow. 

If you could help me or point me in the right direction that would be great.

If you are able to help could you also set out your fees so that I can get a clear picture as to the value of continuing with this project as I currently have just under 500 units still left.

Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

            Hi,

We have Wordpress website and visitors are experiencing major problems when searching for jobs on our website, it takes 30+ seconds to show results.

Also, once you're on the page with results and choose page number 2 or 99, it takes another 30+ seconds to load the page, which is unacceptable.

Can you fix this problem? 
We use VPS and Cache plugins, so the site is fast except for searching queries...        "

            My new windows PC had an update which caused black screen of death. 

I can't restore it via the built in recovery features. I don't own another windows machine to get it installed fresh and I'm kinda useless with windows. 

Just need a clean install of windows so I can have it working as normal. Will need to be on site in Manchester City centre tomorrow (Thurs 4th) or Friday (5th July).

            My name is Victor Vidal and I'm currently looking for someone to help me build an app and a website for a new project that I am looking to launch. The project in mind is to provide a list music studios and production for young up and coming artists to master their craft. It would be equivalent to Airbnb but for music studios around the UK and hopefully worldwide in the future. This would provide easy access for artists as well as producers to find the right space for them to work and would also benefit the music studios into having more exposure in the music scene.
